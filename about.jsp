          <TD><FONT face=arial color=#000000 size=2>Correctional programmes in 
            prisons in nearly all parts of the globe show a significant trend 
            towards specialisation, diversification and experimentation. Another 
            important trend is the substitution of the individualized treatment 
            to prisoners based on their reformative requirements for the earlier 
            doctrine of equal punishment for same crime. The third major trend 
            in prison administration involves an attempt to reduce the social 
            barrier between inmates of the correctional institutions and the 
            civilian community. There is also increasing interest in the 
            possibility that the society or groups of prisoners can be utilised 
            for therapeutic purposes. Group therapeutic and other devices aimed 
            at increasing inmates participation in the routine affairs of prison 
            administration are designed to reduce the barrier between the 
            society and the administrative policy and to give the inmates 
            desired degree of self-esteem and confidence.<BR><BR><IMG height=142

            history of reformation programmes in tune with the current 
            correctional philosophy. Education, Cultural activities, Vocational 
            activities and Moral Education etc. have been going on in Tihar 
            Jails for a long time as a part of the efforts of the Prison 
            Administration for reformation of the prisoners. In the last ten 
            years the process has accelerated and received world wide attention. 
            The reformation package tried out by the Delhi Prison Administration 
            is popularly termed as "New Delhi correctional model", the basic 
            characteristics of which are:<BR>
            <OL type=a>
              <LI>Bringing the community into the prison, 
              <LI>Formation of a self-sufficient community of prisoners, 
              <LI>Participative management. </LI></OL>
            <P>This model strikes a balance between the approaches of 
            "Privatisation of Prison administration" and the "Half way houses". 
            The New Delhi correctional Model has been presented and discussed in 
            Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch at UNO, Vienna and 
            other international and national conferences. It has been deeply 
            appreciated.<BR><BR>Tihar Jail Complex in New Delhi is one of the 
            largest prison complexes in the world. It comprises of nine prisons 
            in the Tihar Complex with a total population of around 9700 
            prisoners against a sanction capacity of 5200 prisoners and one 
            District Jail at Rohini with a total Population of around 1560 
            prisoners against a sanction capacity of 1050 prisoners. In a year 
            about 70,000-80,000 prisoners remain lodged in these prisons for 
            different duration. This prison population has about 80% undertrials 
            and includes about 464 women prisoners with about 62 children below 
            4 years of age dependent upon them. The Detailed Population of 
            Prisoners can be seen in <B><A
